![Silicon Intelligence Dashboard](C:/Users/lanry/.gemini/antigravity/brain/d14d626f-4bcb-4c3f-ab66-9883cc72d74f/dashboard_final_high_res_1769196950275.png)

## Overview
**Silicon Intelligence Authority** is a world-class, autonomous Electronic Design Automation (EDA) ecosystem engineered for **Street Heart Technologies**. It leverages advanced AI—including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)—to master the complex RTL-to-GDSII silicon design flow.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### 1. Topological Intelligence (GNN)
Processes netlists as high-fidelity graphs. Uses custom GNN architectures to predict PPA metrics (Power, Performance, Area) with pinpoint accuracy before physical synthesis.

### 2. Safe Hardware Refactoring (AST Transformer)
Performs safe, tree-based RTL transformations using a professional Verilog/SystemVerilog parser. Features include:
- **Autonomous Pipelining**: Injects register stages to meet timing.
- **Power Mastery**: Automated ICG (Integrated Clock Gate) injection for SkyWater 130nm low-power design.

### 3. Industrial PDK & TCL Sign-off
Ready for production with the **SkyWater 130nm** PDK. Generates sign-off quality TCL scripts for **Cadence Innovus** and **Synopsys Fusion Compiler**.

### 4. Self-Evolving Agents (RL)
Utilizes `RePlAce`-inspired RL strategies that improve placement and routing policies with every tape-out cycle, evolving designs towards optimal PPA convergence.

### 5. Executive Web Portal
A premium Vite + React command center featuring:
- **Live Telemetry**: Real-time synchronization with the Python execution engine.
- **2D Visualizer**: Pulsing floorplan blocks and animated signal-flow paths.
- **CEO Dashboard**: High-level PPA metrics and sign-off milestone tracking.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture
- `agents/`: AI agents for power, placement, and routing.
- `core/`: Primary engines for AST transformation, PDK management, and synthetic design generation.
- `networks/`: GNN and RL neural architectures.
- `silicon-web-portal/`: Premium React frontend for executive visibility.
- `ultimate_signoff.py`: The unified autonomous pipeline execution script.

## 🏁 The Future (Roadmap 2026+)
- Support for **3nm/2nm** ultra-advanced nodes.
- **Hardware-Accelerated EDA** kernels.
- **Cloud-Scale** parallel design iteration.
